# M5StickC-LED-SPIFFS-Server

- A simple SPIFFS web server taht controls the LED of M5Stick-C.

- On the previous web server I’ve written the HTML code for the web server as a String directly on the Arduino sketch. In this web server I wrote the HTML and CSS in a separated file using the extensions .html and .css and save them on the filesystem.

- The web server page shows two buttons: ON and OFF. To turn on the LED click ‘ON’ and click ‘OFF’ to turn off the LED.
